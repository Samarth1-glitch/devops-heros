# Session 15 — Helm

A hands-on session covering **Helm**, the package manager for Kubernetes — charts, releases, values, upgrades, rollbacks, and a mini Notes application.

## Overview

Without Helm, Kubernetes applications are commonly deployed by applying individual YAML files:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
```

Helm packages Kubernetes resources into reusable **Charts** and allows configuration through values.

### Key Concepts

```text
Chart   = Packaged Kubernetes templates
Release = Installed instance of a Chart
Values  = Configuration passed to the Chart
```

---

## 1. Helm Installation & Version

Helm was already installed on the system.

```bash
helm version
```

Version used during the session:

```text
Helm v4.3.0
Kubernetes v1.37
```

---

## 2. Helm Repository

Added the Bitnami repository:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
```

Search for charts:

```bash
helm search repo nginx
```

---

## 3. Installing a Public Helm Chart

Installed the Bitnami NGINX chart:

```bash
helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx
```

Check installed releases:

```bash
helm list
```

Check Kubernetes resources:

```bash
kubectl get all
```

### Removing a Release

```bash
helm uninstall my-nginx
```

### Important Difference

```text
kubectl delete ...
        ↓
Deletes Kubernetes resources

helm uninstall <release>
        ↓
Removes the Helm release and its managed resources
```

---

# 4. Creating a Helm Chart

Helm can generate the basic structure of a new chart:

```bash
helm create myapp
```

Generated structure:

```text
myapp/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml
├── charts/
└── templates/
```

Install the chart:

```bash
helm install my-chart ./myapp
```

If already inside the chart directory:

```bash
helm install my-chart .
```

---

# 5. Helm Chart Structure

A basic Helm chart contains:

```text
myapp/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml
├── charts/
└── templates/
```

### Chart.yaml

Contains chart metadata:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: myapp
version: 0.1.0
```

### values.yaml

Contains configurable values:

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
```

### templates/

Contains Kubernetes manifests with Helm template expressions:

```yaml
replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
```

---

# 6. Helm Lint

`helm lint` checks a chart for possible problems.

```bash
helm lint ./simple-chart
```

Example result:

```text
1 chart(s) linted, 0 chart(s) failed
```

An informational warning about a recommended chart icon was displayed, but the chart passed linting.

---

# 7. Installing and Upgrading Releases

Install a chart:

```bash
helm install my-app ./my-app
```

Attempting to install another release with the same name results in:

```text
cannot reuse a name that is still in use
```

Use `upgrade --install` when you want one command that handles both cases:

```bash
helm upgrade --install my-app ./my-app --set replicaCount=5
```

```text
Release exists          → Upgrade
Release doesn't exist   → Install
```

---

# 8. Helm Release History

Helm keeps track of release revisions.

```bash
helm history simple-chart
```

Example:

```text
REVISION    STATUS
1           superseded
2           superseded
3           deployed
```

Each upgrade creates a new revision.

---

# 9. Helm Rollback

A release can be rolled back to an earlier revision:

```bash
helm rollback simple-chart 1
```

After rollback, Helm creates a new revision representing the rollback.

Example:

```text
Revision 1 → superseded
Revision 2 → superseded
Revision 3 → superseded
Revision 4 → deployed
```

# 10. Mini Project — Notes Application

## Objective

The mini-project packages and deploys a simple Notes application using Helm.

The application is represented by an NGINX container.

The chart structure is:

```text
notes-chart/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml
├── values-prod.yaml
└── templates/
    ├── deployment.yaml
    ├── service.yaml
    └── configmap.yaml
```

---

## 10.1 Chart.yaml

`Chart.yaml` contains chart metadata:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: notes-chart
description: A simple Notes application Helm chart
type: application
version: 0.1.0
appVersion: "1.0"
```

---

## 10.2 values.yaml

Development configuration:

```yaml
replicaCount: 1

image:
  repository: nginx
  tag: "1.24"

service:
  port: 80
  nodePort: 30090

app:
  name: notes-app
  environment: development
```

Development configuration:

```text
Replicas: 1
Image: nginx:1.24
Environment: development
```

---

## 10.3 values-prod.yaml

Production configuration:

```yaml
replicaCount: 3

image:
  repository: nginx
  tag: "1.25"

service:
  port: 80
  nodePort: 30090

app:
  name: notes-app
  environment: production
```

Production configuration:

```text
Replicas: 3
Image: nginx:1.25
Environment: production
```

---

## 10.4 ConfigMap Template

The ConfigMap uses Helm variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-config
data:
  APP_NAME: {{ .Values.app.name | quote }}
  ENVIRONMENT: {{ .Values.app.environment | quote }}
```

Helm substitutes the release name and values when rendering the chart.

---

## 10.5 Deployment Template

The Deployment uses the configured replica count:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
```

The container image is configurable:

```yaml
image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}"
```

The ConfigMap is loaded using:

```yaml
envFrom:
  - configMapRef:
      name: {{ .Release.Name }}-config
```

---

## 10.6 Service Template

The application uses a NodePort Service:

```yaml
spec:
  type: NodePort
```

The port values come from Helm values:

```yaml
port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
targetPort: {{ .Values.service.port }}
nodePort: {{ .Values.service.nodePort }}
```

---

# 11. Lint the Notes Chart

```bash
helm lint notes-chart
```

Result:

```text
1 chart(s) linted, 0 chart(s) failed
```

---

# 12. Render the Chart Locally

Before deploying, the templates were rendered locally:

```bash
helm template notes-dev notes-chart
```

This converts Helm templates such as:

```yaml
{{ .Values.replicaCount }}
```

into normal Kubernetes YAML.

The development values were rendered as:

```yaml
replicas: 1
```

and:

```yaml
image: "nginx:1.24"
```

---

# 13. Install the Development Release

Installed the chart:

```bash
helm install notes-dev notes-chart
```

Verify the resources:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
kubectl get configmaps
```

The development deployment starts with **1 replica**.

---

# 14. Upgrade Using Production Values

The release was upgraded using the production values file:

```bash
helm upgrade notes-dev notes-chart -f notes-chart/values-prod.yaml
```

This changes the configuration from:

```text
Development
1 replica
nginx:1.24
```

to:

```text
Production
3 replicas
nginx:1.25
```

Verify the pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

The deployment runs **3 replicas** after the upgrade.

---

# 15. Check Release History

```bash
helm history notes-dev
```

The release history showed:

```text
REVISION  STATUS
1         superseded
2         deployed
```

Revision 1 was the initial installation.

Revision 2 was the production-value upgrade.

---

# 16. Simulate a Bad Upgrade

A deliberately invalid image tag was used:

```bash
helm upgrade notes-dev notes-chart --set image.tag=broken-tag-does-not-exist
```

Check the pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

The new pods entered:

```text
ImagePullBackOff
```

This demonstrated how a bad Helm upgrade can result in unhealthy Kubernetes workloads.

---

# 17. Rollback to a Healthy Revision

The release was rolled back to revision 2:

```bash
helm rollback notes-dev 2
```

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

The application returned to the healthy production configuration with **3 running replicas**.

### Important Concepts

- **Chart** = reusable package of Kubernetes templates.
- **Release** = installed instance of a chart.
- **Values** = configuration supplied to the chart.
- `helm template` renders templates without deploying them.
- `helm lint` checks chart validity.
- `helm upgrade` creates a new release revision.
- `helm history` shows previous revisions.
- `helm rollback` restores an earlier revision.
- `helm upgrade --install` performs an install when the release does not exist and an upgrade when it does.
- Production-specific configuration can be supplied using a separate values file.
